<div class="desc">
  You find yourself in a dank room.  It appears to have once been an actual
pub, but has long since been abandoned.  The only drinking that goes on in
this place is from a paper bag.  Ever since the arena was built, business
has been sour for old Snooky.  He was sure that business would actually pick
up, but it seems that people interested in blood and gore have no use for
alcohol.  So now it's Snooky that's picked up.  Snooky's pub is abandoned
and filled with litter.
